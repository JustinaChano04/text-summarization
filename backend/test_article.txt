But high mortgage rates are keeping a lid on the spring season, typically the busiest time of year in the housing market. In March, existing-home sales posted their biggest monthly decline in more than a year. 
The low inventory of homes for sale is also thwarting buyers, because high rates have prompted many homeowners to stay put. At the current sales pace, there was a 3.5-month supply of homes on the market at the end of April, below the four to six months’ supply that is generally considered a market balanced between buyers and sellers.
That shortage is pushing prices higher. The national median existing-home price rose 5.7% in April from a year earlier to $407,600, NAR said. That was the highest price for any April data going back to 1999 and approaching the record high of $413,800. Prices aren’t adjusted for inflation.
