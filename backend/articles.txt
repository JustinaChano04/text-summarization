[{'title': 'This is the biggest health challenge women face in their 50s', 'body': '"The majority of women don\'t know what to expect before it happens," Asima Ahmad, a reproductive endocrinology and fertility specialist and chief medical officer at Carrot Fertility, says. "Then, even when symptoms start happening, they don\'t really have a high level of understanding about the differences between perimenopause and menopause."\n\nMenopause is when a woman hasn\'t had a period for at least one year. Perimenopause is the stretch leading up to menopause, when women begin experiencing symptoms associated with the body\'s estrogen production gradually ramping down.\n\n"Everyone\'s journey is going to be a little different," Ahmad says. The median number of years that someone is affected is 7.4, but it extends to between 14 to 20 years for some women. Importantly, it\'s also a key period of changes to women\'s heart and metabolic health.'}]
